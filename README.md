# Saplyn Android

This is an app that tracks daily activity in a generic way.  You can post daily
stats for any activity, from running miles to marathoning Gilmore Girls, and it
will give you statistics that are relevant...generically.

## Testing

Tests can be run from AndroidStudio by simply right clicking the respective test folder and selecting 'run'.

- Robolectric is used for functional and unit tests, which can be found in the app/src/test folder.  
- Espresso is used to run UI and integration tests, which can be found in the app/src/androidTest folder.

## Notes

This repository has been abandoned in order to rebuild using the new Android Architecture Components. I'm keeping around as an example of authenticating a user against the website.
